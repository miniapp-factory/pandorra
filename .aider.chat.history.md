```
A quiz that allows someone to find out which animal (cat, dog, fox, hamster, horse) they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share result. Generate an image for each animal in a cute cartoon vector style and display it on the result page. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question.

Place the quiz on the home page.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The following files in your repository will need to be edited or added to implement the quiz, update the app logo, and change the metadata:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – replace the current content with the quiz component.
2. `mini-app/components/quiz.tsx` – new component that implements the quiz logic and result display.
3. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.
4. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – new file to generate the app logo.
5. `mini-app/public/cat.png.todo` – new file to generate the cat image.
6. `mini-app/public/dog.png.todo` – new file to generate the dog image.
7. `mini-app/public/fox.png.todo` – new file to generate the fox image.
8. `mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo` – new file to generate the hamster image.
9. `mini-app/public/horse.png.todo` – new file to generate the horse image.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each.
